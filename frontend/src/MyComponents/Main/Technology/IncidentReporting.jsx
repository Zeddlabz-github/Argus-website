                        <p className="leading-relaxed text-l font-medium text-gray-2 mb-8">Simple incident reporting helps better gauge guard performance & improve client
                            relations. Incident reporting feature allows guards to add the most important
                            information anytime from any site as conveniently as possible. Traditional pen &
                            paper reporting makes producing a Daily Activity Report a hassle.</p>
                        
                        <h2 className="text-4xl title-font font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-8">Efficient Data Collection</h2>
                        <p className="leading-relaxed text-l font-medium text-gray-2 mb-8">We do not have to spend time chasing down information from guards instead we
                            use it to resolve the issues at hand. Silvertrac’s intuitive mobile guard app is
                            designed to make security report writing as easy as possible so the right people
                            get the right alerts at the right time. Guards simply tap and send and Silvertrac will
                            handle the rest. Report issues straight from the field - in real-time from any
                            property - based on criteria that can be included in any report, like:</p>
                        
                        <ul className="text-l mb-8">
                            <li className="text-gray-2"><span className="font-bold text-red-1">✓</span> Time-stamped photos, audio files, and text notes.</li>
                            <li className="text-gray-2"><span className="font-bold text-red-1">✓</span> Priority levels and notification settings for any issue type. </li>
                            <li className="text-gray-2"><span className="font-bold text-red-1">✓</span> Property-specific issue types </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 className="text-4xl title-font font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-8">Filtered Reports</h2>
                        <p className="leading-relaxed text-l font-medium text-gray-2 mb-8">Each incident is immediately available for review in the Issue Monitor. Reports can
                            be filtered by property, issue type, guard, priority level, and more. This allows any
                            Argus Security to easily create detailed and personalized reports that have
                            everything needed to support client demands. Reports are automatically generated
                            and ready to be delivered to clients, giving them everything they need to know in
                            one bite-sized summary.</p>
