                            can be a difficult process. Traditional security reports like messy, handwritten Daily
                            Activity Reports (DARs) and out-dated forms can make this process even harder.
                            Silvertrac builds detailed reports automatically to reinforce the value that quality
                            security services bring to a client’s operation.</p>

                        <p className="leading-relaxed text-l font-medium text-gray-2 mb-8">Summary Reports give insights into issues in the field by showing every issue at a

                            certain time frame. Monthly, Quarterly and Annual Summaries provide a simple,
                            comprehensive look at everything a team does on behalf of clients. We use these
                            to justify costs, identify current challenges, and reinforce the difference services
