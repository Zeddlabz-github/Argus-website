              The Argus Security Pre-employment screening process involves
              investigating the backgrounds of potential employees to make sure
              that their skills, experience, and attitude meets our standards.
              The screening process is designed to verify the accuracy of an
              applicant’s resume as well as to discover any possible criminal
              history, workers’ compensation claims, or employer sanctions. This
              helps to reduce potential risk to our clients and helps establish
              a high degree of trust with our customers.

              Argus Security Guards are all trained to meet and exceed the
              required security training that the government has regulated. In
              addition to the required government training, Argus Security
              Guards receive enhanced security training that distinguishes them
              as the highest trained in the industry. Our Guards training is
              managed by our very own Learning Management System that is
              integrated with our Human Resource System. This enables the Human
              Resource department to organize the list of Guards that require
              site-specific and advanced training programs. The Argus Security
              Learning Management System helps guide our Guards through the list
              of training programs for career advancement opportunities. Argus
              Security Guards have access to our training portal at any time of
              the day and can see their progress and achievements.

              Argus Security is built on a culture of professionalism. Our
              Guards are trained to maintain a professional attitude. We define
              a professional attitude as someone who has respect, integrity,
              honor, and always is looking out for our customer’s best interest.
              Our Guards’ attitudes must represent the trust that we are

              immediately corrected through a progressive disciplinary action
              plan. With automated weekly performance reviews and Guards’ access
              to their performance metrics, Argus Security maintains the highest
